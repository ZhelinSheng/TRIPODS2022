# Multi-task learning

This is the folder for all content related to the Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning group project for TRIPODS 2022. We are investigating the idea of building a large network that has the capacity to do multiple reinforcement learning tasks. This code base includes a file "Mulit_TaskCode1.ipynb" which contains code for simple RL games as well as RL agent methods discussed in the popular textbook, Introduction to RL by Sutton and Barto. This code base also includes "MTNet.py" which is a multi task neural network implementation. We can currently run this on simple tasks like solving the OR and XOR problems, and we are looking to expand the use of this network to RL tasks.
